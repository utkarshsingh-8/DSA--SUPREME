# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository 📚

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository! This repository is my private collection for studying, practicing, and mastering various data structures and algorithms. It's my digital notebook where I explore and experiment with these fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. 👨‍💻📊

## About This Repository 📋

I've created this repository for my own learning and reference. Whether I'm brushing up on DSA concepts or diving into new ones, this repository serves as a convenient and organized resource to document my progress and code implementations.



## Problem Categories 📚

Delve into an extensive array of data structures and algorithms problems:

1. **Arrays and Strings** 🧵
   - Challenges centered around array manipulations, string operations, and pattern matching.

2. **Linked Lists** 🔗
   - Problems involving singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

3. **Stacks and Queues** 📦
   - Dive into issues related to stack and queue data structures.

4. **Trees and Graphs** 🌳
   - Explore problems tied to binary trees, binary search trees, graphs, and graph algorithms.
